👨🏻‍💻 Customer Behavior Data Analysis — End-to-End Portfolio Project

This repository showcases my complete end-to-end Data Analyst portfolio project, implemented using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
It reflects how real analysts work in modern companies — transforming raw data into business insights and interactive dashboards.

This project demonstrates my capability to:

Clean messy raw data

Model and analyze customer behavior

Run analytical SQL queries

Build dashboards for business users

Present actionable insights

🚀 Project Summary

This is an industry-style data analytics workflow, where I analyzed retail customer behavior to understand:

Customer spending patterns

Shopping frequency

Loyalty behavior

Product category trends

High-value customer segments

The project follows the full lifecycle:

✔️ Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
✔️ Business Analytics using SQL
✔️ Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)
✔️ Final Insights + Presentation Storyboard

📁 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Python — Data Preparation & EDA

Imported and explored raw retail dataset

Cleaned missing and inconsistent values

Performed customer segmentation EDA

Feature engineered fields like purchase frequency, total spend, age buckets, etc.

Exported cleaned data to SQL database

Notebook: Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis.ipynb

2️⃣ SQL — Customer Behavior Analysis

I loaded the cleaned dataset into SQL and wrote multiple analytical queries to answer real-world business questions like:

Which customers spend the most?

What are the most popular product categories?

Who are the most loyal repeat customers?

How does shopping frequency vary across segments?

Which customer segment contributes the highest revenue?

3️⃣ Power BI — Interactive Dashboard

I built a dashboard powered directly by the SQL database.

Key visuals include:

💰 Total Revenue & Avg Basket Size

👥 Customer Segmentation (Age, Gender, Marital Status)

🛒 Most purchased product categories

🔁 Shopping frequency distribution

📅 Monthly spending trends

🏷️ High-value customers (RFM style insights)

File: customer_behavior_dashboard.pbix

4️⃣ Insights & Reporting

Some key observations from my analysis:

A small percentage of customers contribute most of the revenue

Women tend to shop more frequently & spend slightly more

Electronics & Clothing dominate overall purchases

High-frequency customers typically buy in lower ticket sizes but contribute to recurring revenue

Annual customers have the highest average basket size

Young adults (22–30 age group) form the largest active shopper group

I also prepared a slide deck to summarize findings and business recommendations.
